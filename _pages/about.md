Hello! I'm an undergraduate researcher at The University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science and Mathematics in the Turing Scholars honors program. I'm currently working in the Learning Agents Research Group with Drs. Justin Hart and Peter Stone, studying the application of Learning from Human Preferences to tasks involving domestic service robots.
